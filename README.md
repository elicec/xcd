XCD is a quick directory changer. In practice work, 
we generally switch between several commonly used directories. 
When you use XCD to switch directories, XCD will remember these directories
so that you can quickly switch to the history directory next time.

Usage examples:

**xcd**            : List the current stack and its indices.

**xcd somepath**   : Add "somepath" to your directory stack and cd there.

**xcd -h**         : Print this help.
